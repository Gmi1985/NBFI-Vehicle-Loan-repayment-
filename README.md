# NBFI-Vehicle-Loan-Repayment
A non-banking financial institution (NBFI) or non-bank financial company (NBFC) is a type of financial institution that is not authorized to operate as a bank or is not under the supervision of a banking regulatory agency at the national or international level. NBFCs provide financial services similar to those of banks, such as investment, risk pooling, contractual savings, and market brokering.
An NBFC is currently facing profitability issues due to an increase in defaults in the vehicle loan category. The company aims to assess the loan repayment ability of clients and determine the relative importance of each factor contributing to a borrower's ability to repay the loan.

**Objective:**
The objective is to predict whether a client is likely to default on their vehicle loan payment or not.

**Business UseCase:**
The predictive model aids the NBFC in addressing the issue by assessing the risk level of new loan applicants. If a borrower is likely to default, the NBFC can either reject the application or impose stricter lending conditions, such as higher interest rates or reduced loan amounts. This data-driven approach enables the company to make quicker, more informed loan approval decisions. By minimizing defaults, the NBFC can enhance profitability by reducing loan losses and sustaining a healthier loan portfolio.
